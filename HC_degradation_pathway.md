# Hydrocarbons degradation under anaerobic conditions

## HC activation 

### Activation by fumarate addition with fumarate-adding enzymes (FAE) (1)
- Found for aromatic compounds such as toluene, xylenes and ethylbenzene, and non-aromatic compounds (short and long-chain alkanes).
- Catalyzed by enzymes like **benzylsuccinate synthase (BSS)** or **naphthylmethylsuccinate synthases (NMS)**, depending on the substrate.      
- FAE are often used as markers for anaerobic HC degraders because of their well-defined functional affiliation and widespread occurrence.

### Activation by carboxylation 
- Carboxylation is also a conserved initial reaction during anaerobic degradation of benzene and naphthalene.
- Benzoate (benzene metabolite) degradation to benzoyl-CoA involved benzoate activation to benzoyl-CoA catalysed by **benzoate-CoA ligase**. (3)

### Activation by Hydroxylation of benzene to phenol (in Thauera aromatica (DSM6984)) (4)
- Phenol is then convert to phenylphosphate by **phenylphosphate synthase (pps)**
- Next, phenylphosphate is carboxylated to 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-OHB)by the action of **phenylphosphate carboxylase (Ppc)**
- Then, **4-OHB–CoA** ligase and **4-hydroxybenzoyl–CoA reductase** convert 4-OHB as benzoyl-Coa, the central intermediate.
- Phenol degradation in G. metallireducens is accomplished via the same pathway as described for T. aromatica

### Activation of benzene by methylation to toluene (5)



## Benzoyl-CoA degradation
All anaerobic HC degradations have Benzoyl-CoA or analogues as central intermediates. (1)

#### 1. Benzoyl-CoA reductase (Bcr) (1)
- The ring reduction of benzoate is catalysed by the key enzyme benzoyl-CoA reductase (BcrCBAD/BzdNOPQ/BadDEFG) 
- It is an ATP-dependent oxygen-sensitive enzyme 
- In facultative anaerobes
 
#### Benzoyl-CoA reductase (Bam) (class II BCR) (1)
- It is an ATP-independent benzoyl-CoA reductase BamBCDEFGHI
- In strict anaerobes 

#### 2. Ring-cleaving hydrolase (BamA/BzdY/Oah) (1)
- Precedes successive β-oxidation-like reactions, yielding CO2 and three molecules of acetyl-CoA which can be funnelled into central metabolism

#### 3. Beta oxydation

Overview of important peripheral and central pathways in the anaerobic degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons. Genes of key enzyme in use as marker genes for degraders in the environment are as follows: BssA – BSS α-subunit; NmsA – NMS α-subunit; BamB – ATP-independent benzoyl-CoA reductase β-subunit; BcrA/BcrC/BzdN – ATP-dependent BCR subunits; BamA – ring-cleaving 6-oxocylcohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA hydrolase.
