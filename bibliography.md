*Abstract: Two column-type bioelectrochemical system (BES) modules were installed into a 50-L pilot scale reactor packed with diesel-contaminated soils to investigate the enhancement of passive biodegradation of petroleum compounds. By using low cost electrodes such as biochar and graphite granule as non-exhaustible solid-state electron acceptors, the results show that 82.1–89.7% of the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) was degraded after 120 days across 1–34 cm radius of influence (ROI) from the modules. This represents a maximum of 241% increase of biodegradation compared to a baseline control reactor. The current production in the BESs correlated with the TPH removal, reaching the maximum output of 70.4 ± 0.2 mA/m2 . The maximum ROI of the BES, deducting influence from the baseline natural attenuation, was estimated to be more than 90 cm beyond the edge of the reactor (34 cm), and exceed 300 cm should a non-degradation baseline be used. The ratio of the projected ROI to the radius of BES (ROB) module was 11–12. The results suggest that this BES can serve as an innovative and sustainable technology for enhanced in situ bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons in large field scale, with additional benefits of electricity production and being integrated into existing field infrastructures.* <br/> <br/>
The objective is to test the effectiveness of 2 BES designs and granulated graphite and biochar as anode material on TPH and n-alkane remediation, by measuring [TPH], [n-alkane] along distance.<br/>
Soil samples were collected, sieved and partially air dried. **why?**<br/>

*Abstract: Hydrocarbons are relatively recalcitrant compounds and are classified as high-priority pollutants. However, these compounds are slowly degraded by a large variety of microorganisms. Bacteria are able to degrade aliphatic saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons via both aerobic and anaerobic pathways. Branched hydrocarbons and cyclic hydrocarbons are also degraded by bacteria. The aerobic bacteria use different types of oxygenases, including monooxygenase, cytochrome-dependent oxygenase and dioxygenase, to insert one or two atoms of oxygen into their targets. Anaerobic bacteria, on the other hand, employ a variety of simple organic and inorganic molecules, including sulphate, nitrate, carbonate and metals, for hydrocarbon oxidation.*
##### Anaerobic HC biodegradation
**Denitryfing bacteria:** degrade different aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarburs at the expense of nitrate reduction <br/>
**Sulfate reducing microorganism:** Use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor to oxydise organic compounds <br/>
**Metal-Oxidising Microorganisms** <br/>
**Intraaerobic Anaerobes:** This category of microorganisms are able to extract oxygen from chlorate, perchlorate, nitric oxide (NO) or nitrate in order for it to be utilised as an electron acceptor <br/>
**Methanogenesis:** Several anaerobic microorganisms are able to mineralise hydrocarbons to methane as part of microbial syntrophic consortia. Such a consortium can be seen in the syntrophic relationship between methanogenic archaea and hydrogen-producing bacteria for the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons to methane and CO2. H2 is used for the reduction of CO2 into CH4. <br/>

*Abstract: Anaerobic degradation is a key process in many environments either naturally or anthropogenically exposed to petroleum hydrocarbons. Considerable advances into the biochemistry and physiology of selected anaerobic degraders have been achieved over the last decades, especially for the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons. However, researchers have only recently begun to explore the ecology of complex anaerobic hydrocarbon degrader communities directly in their natural habitats, as well as in complex laboratory systems using tools of molecular biology. These approaches have mainly been facilitated by the establishment of a suite of targeted marker gene assays, allowing for rapid and directed insights into the diversity as well as the identity of intrinsic degrader populations and degradation potentials established at hydrocarbon-impacted sites. These are based on genes encoding either peripheral or central key enzymes in aromatic compound breakdown, such as fumarate-adding benzylsuccinate synthases or dearomatizing aryl-coenzyme A reductases, or on aromatic ring-cleaving hydrolases. Here, we review recent advances in this field, explain the different detection methodologies applied, and discuss how the detection of site-specific catabolic gene markers has improved the understanding of processes at contaminated sites. Functional marker gene-based strategies may be vital for the development of a more elaborate population-based assessment and prediction of aromatic degradation potentials in hydrocarbon-impacted environments.*
##### Catabolic pathway 
Fumarate addition is involved in aromatic but also in non aromatic HC degradation.
the genes of FAEs can be considered as widely applicable catabolic markers for anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation in the environment.

##### Anaerobic degraders 
Rhodocyclaceae (Betaproteobacteria), Geobacteraceae, Desulfobacteraceae, Syntrophobacteraceae (Deltaproteobacteria) and Peptococcaceae (Clostridia)
Betaproteobacteria (especially Thauera and Azoarcus strains) are recognized as key organisms for BTEX degradation under nitrate-reducing conditions (Some anaerobic degraders use denitrification to oxydise and activated HC). They activate toluene or xylene isomers by fumarate addition and ethylbenzene by anaerobic hydroxylation of the side chain. Also been reported as secondary degraders in benzene enrichment cultures. <br/>
Sulphate reducing Deltaproteobacteria can mineralize BTEX AND PAH.
Geobacter (belong to the Deltaproteobacteria)...

The monitoring of electrical current in BES used in remediation, offers a continuous monitoring of microorganisms activities.<br/>
**BES designs:** <br/>
Two-chamber BESs tend to be favored for remediation research where the degradation of specific waste is usually examined individually in anodic or cathodic chambers for oxidative or reductive reactions, respectively. <br/>
Unsustainable and/or expensive cathode materials in MFC : impractical to scale up applications for remediation, due to the high material costs and system fragility in the environment. <br/>
In anodic biodegradation studies, a typical design is a two-chamber BES.<br/>
The electrons can transfer to the anode via redox components located on the outer surface of the microorganism (e.g., cytochromes, pilus-like appendages) (like Geobacter spp) and  mediated electron transfer based on diffusible redox mediators, or electroactive substrats, humic substances).<br/>
Little is known about the biochemical mechanisms of microbial electron uptake from a cathode.<br/>
